# 🧠 Score Predictor App

This is a small end-to-end **Score Prediction** application that predicts scores based on user input. The project is structured in a **modular** way using pipelines and reusable components to maintain clean and readable code.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Modular project architecture using custom **pipelines** and **components**
- ✅ Machine Learning models implemented and compared
- ✅ Frontend built with **HTML** and **CSS**
- ✅ Backend powered by **Flask**
- ✅ Deployed on **Azure App Service**

## 🧪 ML Models Used

The following regression models were trained and evaluated:

```python
models = {
    "Random Forest": RandomForestRegressor(),
    "Decision Tree": DecisionTreeRegressor(),
    "Gradient Boosting": GradientBoostingRegressor(),
    "Linear Regression": LinearRegression(),
    "XGBRegressor": XGBRegressor(),
    "CatBoosting Regressor": CatBoostRegressor(verbose=False),
    "AdaBoost Regressor": AdaBoostRegressor(),
}
```

Each model was tested and evaluated using performance metrics like R² score to find the best fit for the dataset.
